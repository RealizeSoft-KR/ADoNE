/**
 * A class designed as a preparatory extension of InteractionOperandResizePolicy, aimed at facilitating future
 * enhancements related to resizing interaction operands within the modeling framework. By overriding the
 * getResizeCommand method, this class currently aligns with the existing functionality of its superclass but
 * stands ready for integration of advanced resizing capabilities. The strategic positioning of this class
 * underscores its purpose for future expansion, enabling the development of more sophisticated resize operations
 * that could further refine user interactions and modeling accuracy.
