/**
 * Defines a custom selection edit policy for lifelines in sequence diagrams, focusing on controlled resizing behavior.
 * This policy enhances lifeline interaction by enforcing specific resizing rules: it allows height increases and width
 * adjustments while strictly preventing height decreases and disallowing any resize attempts in directions other than
 * south (for height) and east (for width). This approach is designed to maintain the diagram's integrity and consistency,
 * especially in scenarios where incoming messages are marked for deletion. By blocking resizing actions that could lead
 * to logical inconsistencies or compromise the structural integrity of the sequence diagram, the policy safeguards against
 * unintended alterations. Through overriding the getResizeCommand method, this policy ensures that all modifications to
 * lifelines are deliberate and contribute positively to the overall modeling process, reinforcing the diagram's clarity
 * and effectiveness.
